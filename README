evpsgi -- PSGI implementation with libevent (version2) httpd

Libevent provides, along with a basic API, http server API. Back in the days
when we discussed differences between PSGI/spec and Plack/implementation,
I decided to embed Perl into libevent httpd to keep diversions of PSGI
implementation. I thought that would help people understand what the PSGI is.

evpsgi is pretty fast because of libevent advantages and a direct embedding.
Although there are some limitations such as a lack of psgi.streaming support,
multi-thread and more, you can enjoy hacking this tiny code.

Dependencies:

   -- Libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)
   -- Perl, http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html

Install:

   ./configure [--with-libevent2=/usr/local] [--with-perl=/usr/local/bin/perl]
   make
   sudo make install
